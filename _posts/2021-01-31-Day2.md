I'd been busy for upgrading my pc in the past few days so I did not have time to practice Blender.  

Today, I made a progress to the point where I can use rendering on blender :)    

In short, I learned how to group objects, adjust lights and use the rendering mode in general.  

The only concerning thing is when I grabbed an object in edit mode, Blender froze often despite having a good GPU, Rtx 3070.   changed settings on Nvidia control panel but that did not help.  

I guess the object was subdevided too much so that it took time to process a task.      

Shift + right click to place the 3d circle. 3d circle indicates where a new objects will be placed.
