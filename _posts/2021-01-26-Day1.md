I got rejected by a company I applied for in the final round today. I kinda feel like shit right now. 
It was a cloud engineer position but they probably guessed that I would never be a good cloud engineer. Well, maybe they are right. I have never thought to be better than nerdy engineers who keeps learning even in their free time.
After giving some thoughts onto what to do next, I have decided to learn Blender to start over. 
Bear in mind that I was never good at designing or drawing in my life. I am not sure how long my motivation will last but I would like to give it a try since 3D modelling is something I can see as an output step by step  


## what I learned today 

watched Blender Beginner tutorial by blender Guru.
Hotkeys seem quite important.
G-Grab
R-Rotate
S-Scale
by pressing X,Y or Z , you can select an axis.

F3 for quick search
